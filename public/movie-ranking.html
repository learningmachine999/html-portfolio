<h3>Vivi the Cinderalla</h3>
<p>This is my favorite romance movie which tells a love story between a boy called Jacob and a girl called
    Vivi. Vivi was born in a middle-class family in the U.S. and Jacob was born in the Royal family in Hainan
    Kingdom. Vivi had to try so hard to become a family member of Huang's. In the end, Vivi became the princess
    and had a happy life with Jacob.
