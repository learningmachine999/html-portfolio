<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Jacob. I came from Hainan, China, an island in the south of the country. I came to the U.S. as a freshman college student at University of Oregon in 2012. 
  My major was Acctounting. I got my first job at Price Waterhouse Coopers after my graduation. Five years later, I decided to seek a different career in the tech industry.
  Currently, I'm a first year graduate student at the Northeastern University.</p>

<p>Speaking of my hobbies, there are hundreds of them. The ones that I spend the most with now are weight-lifting and coffee-making. Recently, I got a new hobby which is roasting
  coffee beans.</p>

<p>My current plan is to focus on my studies and find an internship in any tech company. I'm also planning to open a coffee-roasting workshop and build a website to market it.
  I don't expect to make a lot of money from the workshop. I use it as a media to make more friends who are interesting and love coffee as I do.</p>
